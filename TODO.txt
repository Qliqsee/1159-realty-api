✅ LOGIN FIXED - Using correct LOCAL database

ACTUAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Server runs with .env.local which uses LOCAL database (localhost:5432/realty_db)
- Was mistakenly updating REMOTE database instead of LOCAL
- Local database had OLD schema with single 'name' field
- Code expects firstName, lastName, otherName fields
- Mismatch caused 500 errors

RESOLUTION:
1. Updated LOCAL database schema using dotenv -e .env.local
2. Applied schema changes with prisma db push --accept-data-loss
3. Both signup and login working correctly

DATABASE IN USE:
- PostgreSQL at localhost:5432/realty_db (LOCAL)
- Configured via .env.local file

VERIFIED WORKING:
✅ /auth/signup - Creates users with JWT
✅ /auth/login - Authenticates and returns tokens
✅ Capabilities system - Returns proper permissions
✅ /enrollments/stats - Returns enrollment stats across the app
✅ /enrollments/stats/me - Returns enrollment stats for specific agent
✅ All enrollment endpoints have response examples on swagger
